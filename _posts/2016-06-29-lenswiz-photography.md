  Like most fledgling photographers, when I first started out as a professional
  I thought I needed the biggest, fanciest gear available. I needed a big
  camera, big lenses, a huge Speedlight attached to battery pack on my belt, a
  professional grade tripod, monopod, studio lighting, barn door light
  diffusers, camera sync chords for the flashes, Muslin backdrops, etc.
